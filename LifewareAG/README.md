# Lifeware AG - Technical Screening (Smalltalk Coding Test)

## Overview

This folder contains the full response to a **technical screening test for Lifeware AG**, a software company known for its work in the **insurance and financial services industry**, with a unique focus on **Smalltalk** as the main development language.

The test was designed to evaluate familiarity with:
- Object-oriented design principles
- Algorithmic logic
- The **Smalltalk programming language** and its syntax

All implementations are provided in `.st` (Smalltalk source) files.

## Language Focus: Smalltalk

* Unlike most modern technical interviews that use Java, Python, or C++, this screening test specifically required solutions in **Smalltalk**, a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its pure OO model and live coding environment.

The test not only evaluates logic but also the ability to:
- Think in objects and messages
- Structure code in a modular, readable way
- Follow Smalltalk's method/message-based design patterns

## What You'll Find Here

- * `.st` files with original solutions to the screening tasks
- * Algorithmic thinking applied using **pure object-oriented principles**
- * Real-world example of a modern company still assessing candidates in **Smalltalk**

This folder is particularly valuable for:
- Developers preparing for Smalltalk-based roles (rare but specialized)
- Candidates exploring niche languages used in legacy or high-stability enterprise systems
- Interviewers looking for example tests in non-mainstream languages
