# Lifeware AG — Second Technical Coding Interview (Smalltalk OOP)

This folder contains coding tasks from the **second technical coding interview** for Lifeware AG, focusing on **Smalltalk** and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Overview

- **6 coding tasks** aimed at fixing and completing unit tests  
- The 6th task emphasizes creativity and problem-solving beyond standard fixes  
- One interview question requires identifying where the default values for the first test are set  
- Includes two remark files (`Remarks1.txt`, `Remarks2.txt`) with suggested on-the-fly implementations (these suggestions are *not* fully functional)  
- Completing all 6 tasks alone is *not* sufficient to pass the interview — further discussion and evaluation are expected

## How to Use

1. Review each task and the associated unit tests.  
2. Attempt to fix and improve the code to pass all tests.  
3. Pay special attention to the 6th task, which encourages creative problem-solving.  
4. Understand the setup of default values as it may be tested verbally.  
5. Consider the remarks as hints but note they do not represent final solutions.
