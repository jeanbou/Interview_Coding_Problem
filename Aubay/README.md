# Aubay - Codingame Interview Task (Join Point Problem in Java)

## Overview

This folder contains my solution to a **Codingame-style technical interview task** completed during a live coding session with **Aubay**. The task was to find the **join point of two integer sequences**, a known problem often discussed on developer forums.
