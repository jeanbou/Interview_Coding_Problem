# BCE Group - Technical Coding Tasks for Interview Screening

## Overview

This folder contains my solutions to **two technical coding tasks** requested by **BCE Group Luxembourg** as part of their candidate screening process.

Each task represents a real-world problem that candidates may face during backend, data processing, or general software development interviews. The challenges assess practical programming skills, algorithmic reasoning, and the ability to produce clean, testable code under time constraints.

## Contents

### Task 1: Technical_Coding_Task1

- Focuses on file-based data parsing and business logic extraction.
- Requires careful handling of input/output processing and structured data flow.
- Strong emphasis on practical, production-style implementation.

### Task 2: Technical_Coding_Task2

- Challenges your ability to reason through logical conditions and simulate outcomes.
- Involves more abstract logic and scenario-driven validation.
- Encourages writing modular, reusable code blocks.

## Interview Context

- These exercises were part of an **initial technical screening round**.
- The goal was to evaluate core development capabilities before moving to further interview stages.
- A detailed `.rtf` feedback file is included for each task, summarizing problem understanding, task complexity, and post-submission feedback provided to BCE’s technical leadership.

## Purpose

- This repository helps others understand the **types of coding tasks used in hiring processes** at BCE Group and similar enterprise organizations.
- It serves as a reference for practicing:
  - File parsing and transformation logic
  - Data simulation or algorithm design
  - Writing testable and clean Java code
