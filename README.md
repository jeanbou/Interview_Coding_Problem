## Real Coding Interview Questions & Solutions from Top Tech Companies

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of real coding problems, algorithm tasks, and technical screening questions I personally solved during interview processes with top tech companies.

Each subfolder contains:
- Company-specific coding tasks (e.g., Meta, Goldman Sachs, Adyen)
- My own optimized or quick-to-submit solutions
- Multi-language implementations (when applicable)
- Follow-up refinements based on well-known sources like GeeksForGeeks, LeetCode, JournalDev, and more.

## Why This Repository?

- Fast-track your interview prep with real-life coding examples
- Compare multiple strategies: fast-to-submit vs. deeply optimized
- Practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving
- Contributions welcome: improve or refactor any solution

## Repository Structure

- Each folder = one company (e.g., `/Meta/`, `/GoldmanSachs/`)
- Inside: the questions I faced + my coded solutions
- Languages used include Python, Java, C++, and more
