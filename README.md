# Interview Coding Problem 2
*Description:*

This repository contains my solutions of the task / problems that have been requested to code or expected to be answered as a code durting the job-interviews:

*It is organized in the following way:*

- submitted and lately corrected the most optimal solutions that turns fast
- most frequently "Asked To Get and Code" by various companies (see folder names) which these companies used to ask everytime (found on the different forums) 

*With the following goals:*
* screen candidates in or out
* published out the feedbacks as comments from many IT forums, hiring web sites 

## The goal of my coding inisde this folder was:
* to be prepared and to have a good collection of ready to reproduce pieces of code.
* some "look-up'ed" enhanced solution to study deeply & understand from algorithm dedicated dev sites such as GeeksForGeeks, JournalDev etc

## Notes
- the all credits and references on the authors are respected
- some tasks are coded at sub-optimal but with quick-to-submit alorithms: you can correct them (looking forward to your commits to merge)
