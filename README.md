**with**

* the last found corrected the most optimal solutions that turns fast
* most frequently "Asked To Code Quick" by various companies (see folder names) : this question seems to be asked everytime (I've found it on the different forums) 

## The goal of my shared codes were:
* to be prepared and to have a good collection of ready to reproduce pieces of code.
* some "look-up'ed" enhanced solution to study deeply & understand from algorithm dedicated from Dev. sites such as GeeksForGeeks, JournalDev etc
