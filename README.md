## Real Coding Interview Questions & Solutions from Top Tech Companies

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of real coding problems, algorithm tasks, and technical screening questions I personally solved during interview processes with top tech companies.

Each subfolder contains:
- Company-specific coding tasks (e.g., Meta, Goldman Sachs, Adyen)
- My own **optimized** or **quick-to-submit** solutions
- Multi-language implementations (when applicable)
- Follow-up refinements based on well-known sources like **GeeksForGeeks**, **LeetCode**, **JournalDev**, and more.

## ?? Why This Repository?

- ? **Prepare faster** with real-life examples used in technical screening interviews.
- ?? **Compare strategies**: some solutions are ideal for submission speed, others are further improved after deeper study.
- ?? **Sharpen your skills** with a wide range of problems covering data structures, algorithms, and system design patterns.
- ?? **Contribute**: Some quick-and-dirty solutions are marked and ready to be optimized — feel free to submit better alternatives via PRs.

## ?? Structure

- Each folder = one company (e.g., `/Meta/`, `/GoldmanSachs/`)
- Inside = the coding questions + my solutions
- Language used depends on context: Python, Java, C++, etc.
