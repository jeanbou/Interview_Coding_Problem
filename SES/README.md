# SES - Full-Stack Developer Technical Challenge (No Fixed Deadline)

## Overview

This folder contains the complete response to a **Full-Stack Developer technical challenge from SES**, one of the world’s leading satellite and telecommunications operators. The task was **open-ended (no fixed deadline)** and designed to evaluate both **software engineering** and **technical communication skills**.

The challenge was shared in the form of a PDF briefing and required candidates to return:
- Well-structured code for specific technical tasks (in Java, Go, and Python)
- A written explanation justifying technical decisions and implementation details

---

## Challenge Breakdown

* `Full-Stack Developer.pdf`  
Contains the original project and task brief with multi-language coding requests and system-level problem-solving.

---

## Folder Structure and Description

### `task1a/` and `task1b/`  
* **Database Normalization Exercises**  
Each folder contains one DB schema normalization task, typically requiring 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF compliance, showcasing understanding of relational database principles and data modeling.

---

### `task2a/`  
* **Java Algorithm Task**  
Implements an **efficient algorithm in Java**, focusing on optimization and clean code. This task is likely meant to test algorithmic thinking, time complexity awareness, and Java coding best practices.

---

### `Project2/`  
* **Load Time-Based Balancer in Go (and Python)**  
A small system project with two components:
-  **Go**: Implementation of a load-time-based reverse proxy or load balancer
-  **Python Flask**: Lightweight resource servers used for simulation and testing  
*  **Note**: This version does *not* include health checking features. The goal was to build a prototype balancing based purely on response/load time, not service health.

---

### `Documents/`  
* **Written Documentation and Justification**  
Contains detailed explanations of:
- Design choices for each task
- Trade-offs considered during development
- Implementation steps and potential improvements

This section is **as important as the code itself**. SES emphasized **clarity, depth, and specificity**, discouraging vague or generic answers.

---

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Relational Database Design** (Normalization, Schema Understanding)
- **Algorithm Design & Optimization** (Java)
- **Go (Golang) Networking** (Building custom proxy/load logic)
- **Python (Flask)** (Backend simulation)
- **Technical Communication** (Comprehensive documentation, system reasoning)
