# Anaplan

During the Anaplan HackerRanks Core Java Codig Test, I had:
* Several Core Java Questions (there was enough time to double check it in Eclipse
* Coding tasks:

	A) Cup Cake Chocolate Feast, credits [go to this link](https://github.com/havelessbemore/hackerrank/blob/master/algorithms/implementation/chocolate-feast.java)

	B) Parser Credits [go to this link](https://repl.it/@narasakumar/FlippantDualDobermanpinscher) and [go to this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48779489/regular-expression-to-find-a-string-included-between-two-brackets)
           Code was quickly addapted

	C) Spread Sheet Notation Convertion, didn't have a time to finish it during the coding Hacker Rank Session due to the lack of testing
	   But found a good source of code at internet that was not able to finalised for the given requirement
