# Anaplan - Core Java Interview Coding Challenges (HackerRank)

## Overview

This folder contains my solutions and notes from the **Anaplan technical screening** conducted via **HackerRank**, which included several Core Java coding tasks and theoretical questions.

The test allowed enough time for code review and local testing in Eclipse. The tasks focused on **Java fundamentals**, **string parsing**, and **algorithmic problem-solving**.

## Tasks Included

### 1. Chocolate Feast (Adapted from HackerRank)

A classic implementation challenge often used in interviews.

### 3. Spreadsheet Notation Converter

A partially completed task due to limited time during the coding session. Focused on converting Excel-style column/row notations.
