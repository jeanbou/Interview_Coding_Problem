Given 2 interval ranges, create a function to tell me if these ranges intersect. Both start and end are inclusive: [start, end] Given 2 interval ranges that intersect, now create a function to merge the 2 ranges into a single continuous range. Now create a function that takes a group of unsorted, unorganized intervals, merge any intervals that intersect and sort them. The result should be a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals. Now create a function to merge a new interval into a group of sorted, non-intersecting intervals. After the merge, all intervals should remain non-intersecting. You are given the function definition below.
