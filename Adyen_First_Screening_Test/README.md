# Adyen - Java & SQL Interview Coding Challenges

## Overview

This folder contains my solutions to the **Adyen first-round technical screening test**, which included a total of **4 problems** combining **Java programming** and **SQL querying**.

These challenges were designed to evaluate practical knowledge in:
- Database querying and logic with SQL
- Object-oriented design and core Java skills
- Problem-solving under time pressure in an interview context

---

## Task Breakdown

- **Problem 1:** SQL task focusing on data manipulation, filtering, and joins.
- **Problems 2 - 4:** Java-based coding problems covering algorithmic thinking, data structures, and object-oriented programming concepts.

---

## Purpose

- Designed as part of my preparation and solution tracking during the interview process with **Adyen**.
- Serves as a reference for candidates preparing for similar backend or full-stack roles involving **Java and SQL**.
- Meant to be reusable and adaptable for mock interviews, timed coding sessions, or studying core concepts.

---

## Notes

- Code may not be fully polished, as it was written under interview constraints.
- The logic is correct and functional but could be improved with further refinement and testing.
- Suggestions, improvements, and PRs are welcome.
