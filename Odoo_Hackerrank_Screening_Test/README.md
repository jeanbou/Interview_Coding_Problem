# Odoo - HackerRank Screening Test (October 2021)

## Overview

This folder documents a technical screening process for a developer role at **Odoo**, conducted through the **HackerRank platform** in **October 2021**. The content includes:

- The actual tasks received before the interview (in PDF format)
- Java code implementations for algorithmic exercises
- A personal remark: **none of the 3 tasks included here were reused during the actual interview session**

Even though the original HackerRank questions were not used later, the material offers insight into the types of tasks companies like Odoo might consider for pre-interview technical assessments.

## Folder Structure

### `Recieved_3Tasks2Code/`  
* Contains the **three original coding tasks in PDF format** that were received ahead of the screening test. These provide context for how HackerRank challenges are formatted and what problem types may be expected.

- Each PDF outlines a programming challenge
- Tasks typically focus on string parsing, data structures, or logic puzzles
- Can be used as standalone mock tests for timed practice

### Java Code Files (in root folder)  
* Includes Java-based solution drafts for the tasks, prepared in anticipation of the screening. These drafts demonstrate:
- Time-efficient problem-solving strategy
- Use of standard Java libraries
- Algorithmic reasoning (not polished production code)

---

## Purpose of This Repository

- Document and archive technical screening prep materials
- Share Java coding strategies for solving logic-based problems
- Offer a real-world example of how pre-interview prep may not always align with the live session—but still adds value

---

## Notes

- **Date of interview invitation**: 13 October 2021
- **None of the 3 provided tasks appeared in the live HackerRank session**
- Still useful for interview practice and Java logic development
- Ideal for those targeting Odoo or other companies using HackerRank
