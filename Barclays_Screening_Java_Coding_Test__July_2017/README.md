# Barclays - Java Coding Test (July 2017)

## Overview

This folder contains my quick solutions to the **Java technical coding test** conducted by **Barclays** in **July 2017**. These implementations reflect the kind of logic and structure used during timed interviews and coding assessments.

The main focus is to **demonstrate working solutions under pressure**, with clear, functional logic that can be further optimized in a preparatory or review phase.

## Purpose

- Useful for candidates preparing for **Java-based coding interviews**
- Demonstrates realistic solutions produced during **live technical assessments**
- Encourages future optimization and deeper understanding of performance tuning

---

## Recommendations

- If you're in the **preparation phase**, study the code structure and try to improve:
  - Runtime complexity
  - Memory usage
  - Code readability and modularity

- All important details and considerations are explained in the **code comments**. Be sure to review them carefully.
