# Rakuten - Codility Technical Interview Prep (July 2017)

## Overview

This folder contains preparation material for a **technical screening interview with Rakuten Japan**, conducted in **July 2017** via the **Codility online platform**. The content includes raw algorithm drafts, code snippets, and logical strategies specifically designed to mirror the format and time pressure of real Codility-based assessments.

Whether you're preparing for Rakuten or any company using Codility-style tests, this folder offers insight into timed coding prep from an actual candidate experience.

---

## What You'll Find Here

- * Draft solutions to common Codility problem types
- * Algorithmic patterns captured in raw form (before refinement)
- * Reusable logic blocks and ideas from various prep sources

The code and comments are **not production-grade**, but are instead optimized for:
- Speedy understanding of the core problem
- Quick testing of logic
- Rapid iteration and adaptation under time constraints

---

## Technical Context

- Platform: **Codility**
- Company: **Rakuten Japan**
- Date: **July 2017**
- Focus Areas:
  - Arrays and sequences
  - Counting and prefix sums
  - Sorting, time complexity
  - Greedy and edge case intuition

This reflects Rakuten's approach to filtering candidates through fast-paced, logic-heavy online assessments.

---

## Practical Use Cases

- * Preparing for **Codility-based interviews**
- * Practicing under **timed coding test** conditions
- * Reviewing **problem-solving patterns** quickly
- * Understanding how interview prep looked in 2017 (and what's still relevant)

## Notes and Disclaimers

- This folder contains **idea sketches**, not final implementations.
- Some logic may lack full validation or explanatory comments.
- Perfect for inspiration or study, but not ready for direct reuse in live systems.

---

## Recommended Enhancements

- Add unit tests for core logic blocks
- Refactor key algorithms for readability and performance
- Annotate logic with time/space complexity notes

Contributions welcome if you’d like to polish or modernize these drafts!
