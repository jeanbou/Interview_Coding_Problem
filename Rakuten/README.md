# Rakuten - Coding Interview Preparation (Codility - July 2017)

## Overview

This folder contains coding problem drafts and algorithmic ideas prepared specifically for a technical interview with **Rakuten Japan**, conducted in **July 2017**.

The coding session took place on the **Codility platform**, and this content was assembled to help simulate and solve similar real-world challenges under timed conditions.

---

## What You'll Find Here

- Draft solutions for Codility-style problems
- Focused on **algorithmic reasoning** and **problem-solving**
- Quick recollections of patterns and approaches found across:
  - Developer forums
  - Interview preparation websites
  - Problem-solving communities

These drafts are intended as **idea blueprints** rather than polished, production-ready code. The main objective was to **understand the logic quickly** and **adapt the algorithm** to the Codility test format.

---

## Why This Matters

- Real-world example of **time-sensitive interview prep**
- Practical code fragments and logic building blocks
- Insight into Rakuten’s technical assessment process in 2017
- Useful for candidates targeting **Rakuten** or any **Codility-based interviews**

---

## Notes

- These are **raw drafts**, not final implementations.
- Some code may lack full edge case coverage or comments.
- Contributions, improvements, and refactors are welcome.
